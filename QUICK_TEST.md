## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Backend won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Problem: Frontend won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Problem: "No users available"
**Cause:** You only opened one window  
**Solution:** Open a second browser window (or Incognito tab)

### Problem: Camera/Mic permission denied
**Solution:**
- Click the 🔒 lock icon in browser address bar
- Change Camera/Microphone to "Allow"
- Refresh the page

### Problem: Stuck at "Connecting..."
**Possible causes:**
1. Firewall blocking WebRTC
2. No internet (STUN servers can't be reached)
3. VPN interfering

**Solution:**
- Disable VPN temporarily
- Check firewall settings
- Try different network
- Check browser console for errors
